The IBM Maintenance Device-2 (MD-2) is a briefcase-sized diagnostic device for IBM mainframe peripherals like the 3380, 3370, and 3480. Rather than embed complex diagnostic processing and interfaces into multiple IBM products, IBM designed the MD to use a common interface to these peripherals, and the MD would run product-specific diagnostics loaded from diskette. Diagnostics could then be enhanced via replacement diskettes rather than having to upgrade diagnostic facilities in thousands of machines at customer sites.

The MD could also connect to a modem and "call home" to IBM's internal network to upload diagnostic information, to download updates to the diagnostic diskettes, or even to allow "remote access" to the MD from next levels of support while the MD was connected to customer equipment.

The MD includes a variety of interfaces to connect to a host of different products:

- A "barrel connector" which was a standard diagnostic interface to a number of different machines
- An "S-loop" interface to connect to IBM Retail Store System devices like the 3650 and 4680 Point-of-Sale systems
- An "R-loop" interface to connect to the IBM 8100 Distributed Processing System
- A "PIO" port which supported a printer. It's not known if the PIO port supported any input to the MD.

The MD is "officially" known as the IBM 901X Model 2 Maintenance Device, but commonly referred to as "MD" or "MD-2" (there _was_ at one point an "MD-1").

While these were common IBM diagnostic tools, they were not restricted to internal use. They were used by third-party maintainers of equipment, and the MD was manufactured in pretty large numbers (relatively speaking).

They are relatively commonly available today, though most of the ones you find nowadays are missing the diskettes and test/wrap plugs.

Mention an MD-2 on any retro-computing or IBM group on the Internet and you'll find a bunch of people who've used them in the past, but betond "I've used one of those before", there's not much information available on them available anymore, and I hope to change that as much as I can.

This repository includes the following hopefully useful information:

Hardware: Notes on the hardware in the MD and tips on repairing or restoring
