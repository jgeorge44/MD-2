The MD Power Supply contains the following Electrolytic Capacitors, for reference.

So far even in older MD units these caps have not shown signs of leaking or failing, and should *not* be considered for proactive replacement. However, they are listed here for reference. When replacing capacitors with modern equivalents, consider upgrading to 105C capacitors or slightly higher DC voltage limits.

C5 C6: 220uF 200VDC 85C 
C24: 2200uF 35VDC 85C
C27: 10uF 16VDC 85C
C31: 2.2uF 250VDC 85C
C32 C44: 1000uF 35VDC 85C
C46 C47 C50: 220uF 35VDC 85C
